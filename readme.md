# Where Next - 3rd Year Web Development Assignment

This website was created with the purpose of letting users discover what would be their next best holiday destination. There are twelve destinations implemented, each with their own description and listed attractions.
You can treat my website as a sort of encyclopedia of places to visit. If you find something appealing, you can fill in some details and then be taken to Skyscanner to see if there are any flights available. The search on Skyscanner
is unique based on what you entered, such as the departing airport and the departure and returning dates.

## Explore Page

The `homepage` of the website. You can use this to explore the different destinations that have been implemented. Clicking onto any of the pictures takes you to its profile. 
From there you can read about what this site has to offer on Wikipedia. 
If you want to see travel options, fill in the form and press Check Flights takes you to Skyscanner.net with the details you've entered from the form.
Originally this was going to use an API that would populate a table with flying options for you. However, I could not find one that was free to use.

## Locations Page

A `list of all` the destinations implemented. You can sort this table alphabetically by Country or Location by clicking on the headings. This table is dynamic meaning adding more destinations to the HTML will then add them to this table.

## Recommended Page

By filling in the form, you can `get a destination recommended` to you. This is then stored in local storage to allow you to access it again, or you can delete it on this page.

## About Page

The `information` page explaining the purpose of the site as well as sources & references.
